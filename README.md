## Overview
RiverSide General Hospital is a full-service healthcare facility committed to delivering high-quality medical care to its community. 
With specialized departments in emergency medicine, surgery, and outpatient services, the hospital meets a wide range of patient needs while maintaining a strong focus on safety and satisfaction. 
RiverSide continually works to enhance health outcomes and promote overall community well-being. Currently, the hospital relies on a flat-file data system, which presents several challenges: 
- Scalability: As data volumes increase, the system becomes slow and inefficient for performing advanced analytics.
- Integration: Data from other sources must be integrated manually, leading to delays and processing inefficiencies.

## Project Aim
This project proposes the design of an optimized data model using Draw.io to better structure RiverSide Hospital’s data, enabling faster, more reliable, and scalable analysis.
